# Running Shoe Adviser

<div style="text-align: left"> I am trying coding for the first time and here is my first work.  </div>

**Running shoe adviser** is a very simple program. Based on some criterias (Gender, Brand, Terrain type, Pace, Arch Support, Weight and Price) it finds running shoes. The shoe database is very limited. I am doing this as the off-platform project of Codecademy.
